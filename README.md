# 🎮 Simple Number Guessing Game

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a simple interactive game using **conditional statements** to control game logic and decision-making.

---

## 🕹️ Game Type
**Number Guessing Game**

---

## 📜 Game Rules
1. The computer generates a random number within a fixed range (for example, 1 to 10).
2. The player is asked to guess the number.
3. The program compares the guessed number with the generated number:
   - If the guess is correct, the player wins.
   - If the guess is higher than the number, a hint is displayed.
   - If the guess is lower than the number, a hint is displayed.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

---

## 🧠 Game Logic
- Generate a random number at the start of the game.
- Accept user input for the guess.
- Use conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to check the guess.
- Provide feedback after each guess.
- End the game when the player guesses correctly.

## 🔧 Concepts Used
- Conditional Statements
- User Input Handling
- Basic Control Flow

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Run the program using a suitable compiler or interpreter.
2. Enter a number when prompted.
3. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen.

---

## 🧪 Testing and Debugging
- Tested for correct and incorrect guesses.
- Verified game flow using multiple inputs.
- Ensured conditions work correctly without errors.

---

## ✅ Expected Output
- Displays hints for wrong guesses.
- Displays a success message when the correct number is guessed.

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of conditional statements
- Improved logical thinking
- Experience with simple game development
